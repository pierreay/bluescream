*Ph.D. Thesis*

This project is also part of my Ph.D. Thesis, not yet published.

*Repositories*

This repository mainly contains source code and small demos. However, the full
project is composed of:
- [[https://github.com/pierreay/screaming_channels_data][screaming_channels_data]] :: Holds datasets and experiments -- signals,
  profiles, scripts.
- [[https://github.com/pierreay/screaming_channels_paper][screaming_channels_paper]] :: Holds the aforementioned paper source code.
- [[https://github.com/pierreay/screaming_channels_poc][screaming_channels_poc]] :: Holds custom version of the Screaming Channels
  project, on which this one is based on. All credits goes to [[https://github.com/eurecom-s3/screaming_channels][EURECOM]].

* Reproducing

Here are some hints about reproducing our results. More precise instructions
can be found in the documentation (see =docs=). More precise demonstrations can
be found in the experiments (see =screaming_channels_data=).

** Dependencies for Recording

*Software*

Libraries:
- [[https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR][SoapySDR]] :: The library for recording I/Q samples with an SDR.
- [[https://github.com/pierreay/whad][WHAD]] :: A custom version of the framework for wireless hacking. All credits
  goes to the [[https://github.com/whad-team/whad-client][WHAD team]].

Firmware:
- [[https://github.com/pierreay/butterfly][ButteRFly]] :: The attacker firmware. A custom version of the WHAD-enabled for
  low-level traffic injection. All credits goes to the [[https://github.com/whad-team/butterfly][WHAD team]].
- [[https://github.com/pierreay/screaming_channels_nimble.git][NimBLE]] :: The victim firmware. A custom version of the [[https://mynewt.apache.org/][Apache MyNewt BLE]]
  firmware.

*Hardware*

- [[https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nrf52840-dongle][nRF52840]] :: The attacker dongle.
- [[https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF52-DK][nRF52832 (PCA10040)]] :: The victim board.
- SDR (/e.g./, [[https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/][HackRF]], [[https://www.ettus.com/product-categories/usrp-bus-series/][USRP]]) :: The radio to record the leakage.

** Dependencies for Attacking

*Software*

- [[https://github.com/pierreay/python_hel][Histogram-Enumeration Library (HEL)]] :: Key enumeration and estimation
  library. All credits goes to [[https://github.com/giocamurati/python_hel][Giovanni Camurati]].
- [[https://numpy.org/][Numpy]] :: Well-known Python scientific computation library.

* Source code

The source code is composed of utilities, libraries and individuals scripts.

Most important files:
- [[file:src/collect.sh][src/collect.sh]] :: Collect a complete dataset, leveraging =src/radio.py=.
- [[file:src/dataset.py][src/dataset.py]] :: Perform multiprocessor dataset processing.
- [[file:src/radio.py][src/radio.py]] :: Instrument the victim to make it scream and record the
  leakage for one trace. Leverage =src/lib/soapysdr.py= for I/Q recording and
  =src/lib/device.py= for victim instrumentation.
- [[file:src/attack.py][src/attack.py]] :: Perform side-channel attacks on a dataset (/e.g./, CRA or
  Template Attack).
- [[file:src/lib/device.py][src/lib/device.py]] :: Victim instrumentation leveraging WHAD to manipulate BLE
  parameters.
- [[file:src/lib/soapysdr.py][src/lib/soapysdr.py]] :: Radio instrumentation leveraging SoapySDR to record
  I/Q at the right time.
- [[file:src/lib/analyze.py][src/lib/analyze.py]] :: Digital signal processing and statistics helpers.
